<h1>Hello class,</h1>
  <p>My name is Sam, and I am a Senior in <strong>Community and Regional Planning</strong> and am pursuing minors in <strong>GIS</strong> and <strong>Environmental Studies.</strong> 
  I am also on campus this semester. 
  
  I don't have any experience in HTML and JavaScript, but I do have some prior coding experience. I took a class in python last semester. 
  I also have taken a few GIS classes and have had a couple GIS internships. 
  
  I am hoping to learn more about ArcGIS online and making web maps because most of my experience has been on the desktop versions of GIS. 
  I am also excited to learn about other coding languages and how I can use those to enhance my GIS skills.</p>
